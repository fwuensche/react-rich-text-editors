## Methodology

We'll start by designing the desired interface for our base component.

We'll analyze the open-source alternatives available in the market.

We'll pick the most promising ones and try them out, i.e, implement a POC with:

- All the basic use cases currently covered by Quill
- variables
- tables
- image upload
- tagging other users

## Pending

General

- improve show source button to toggle code inline
- move readme to root folder so that it's rendered on github

Lexical
